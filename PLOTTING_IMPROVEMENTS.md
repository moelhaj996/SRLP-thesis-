# Y-Axis Consistency Improvements for Thesis Figures

## Overview
Updated all matplotlib/seaborn plotting functions to ensure consistent and fair y-axis scaling across all thesis figures. This addresses academic standards for data visualization and prevents misleading visual comparisons.

## Changes Made

### ðŸ“Š Figure 4.1: PQS Distribution by Strategy (Boxplot)
```python
# Before: Natural range based on data
# After: Full scoring scale for context
ax.set_ylim(0, 100)  # Show complete PQS scale (0-100)
```
**Rationale**: Shows the full scoring range, providing proper context for PQS values and preventing compressed visual interpretation.

### ðŸ“ˆ Figure 4.2: Provider Performance (Bar Charts)
```python
# Before: Automatic scaling
# After: Fair comparison starting at zero
ax1.set_ylim(0, None)  # Time comparison
ax2.set_ylim(0, None)  # Cost comparison
```
**Rationale**: Ensures fair visual comparison between providers. Starting at 0 prevents exaggerated visual differences that could mislead readers.

### ðŸ“Š Figure 4.3: SRLP Gains by Domain (Grouped Bar Chart)
```python
# Before: Automatic scaling
# After: Fair gain comparison
ax.set_ylim(0, None)  # Performance gains
```
**Rationale**: Provides accurate visual representation of relative gains. Starting at 0 ensures that percentage improvements are visually proportional.

### ðŸ“ˆ Figure 4.4: PQS by Complexity (Grouped Bar Chart)
```python
# Before: Automatic scaling
# After: Fair strategy comparison
ax.set_ylim(0, None)  # Mean PQS values
```
**Rationale**: Enables fair visual comparison between strategies across complexity levels. Prevents misleading emphasis on small differences.

### ðŸŽ¯ Figure 4.5: Cognitive Capabilities (Radar Chart)
```python
# Before: Already set correctly
# After: Maintained consistent 0-100 scale
ax.set_ylim(0, 100)  # All cognitive metrics
```
**Rationale**: Maintains the full metric scale (0-100) for all cognitive dimensions, ensuring balanced visual representation.

## Academic Benefits

### 1. **Visual Fairness**
- All comparisons start from a common baseline (0)
- Prevents exaggerated visual differences
- Enables accurate visual assessment of relative performance

### 2. **Consistency**
- Uniform approach across all thesis figures
- Professional academic presentation standards
- Easier for readers to compare across figures

### 3. **Transparency**
- Full context provided for all metrics
- No hidden baseline adjustments
- Clear visual representation of actual differences

### 4. **Thesis Quality**
- Meets academic publication standards
- Prevents potential criticism of misleading visuals
- Demonstrates methodological rigor

## Implementation Details

### Updated Functions
- `_generate_figure_pqs_by_strategy()` - Full 0-100 PQS scale
- `_generate_figure_provider_performance()` - Zero-based time/cost
- `_generate_figure_domain_gains()` - Zero-based gain percentages
- `_generate_figure_pqs_by_complexity()` - Zero-based PQS comparison
- `_generate_figure_sccs_by_dimension()` - Maintained 0-100 scale

### Testing
- âœ… All plots generate successfully with new y-axis settings
- âœ… Visual consistency verified across all 5 figures
- âœ… No impact on data accuracy or statistical validity
- âœ… Professional appearance maintained

## Usage
The improvements are automatically applied whenever artifacts are generated:

```bash
# Integrated with evaluation
python run_evaluation.py --providers gpt4,claude3,gemini --strategies srlp,cot,tot,react

# Standalone generation
python generate_artifacts.py results_full/evaluation_results.csv

# Test with sample data
python test_artifacts.py
```

## Result
All thesis figures now use consistent, fair y-axis scaling that meets academic publication standards and provides accurate visual representation of the evaluation results.
