ADVANCED STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=====================================

Figures Generated:
1. Enhanced PQS Distribution (Figure 1) - Welch's ANOVA, violin plots, effect sizes
2. Ablation Study (Figure 10) - Component contribution analysis
3. Human Evaluation Validation (Figure 11) - Metric reliability analysis
4. Computational Efficiency (Figure 12) - Scalability and trade-off analysis

Statistical Methods Implemented:
✅ Welch's ANOVA for unequal sample sizes
✅ Post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction
✅ Cohen's d effect size calculations
✅ Bootstrap confidence intervals (B=2000)
✅ Significance testing with star annotations
✅ Power analysis and sample size justification

Publication Quality Features:
